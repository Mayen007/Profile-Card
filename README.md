## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design with media queries
- Custom fonts with `@font-face`
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This challenge allowed me to refine my skills in creating responsive designs and using custom fonts. Here's a piece of code Iâ€™m particularly proud of:

```css
body {
  background: url(./assets/images/bg-pattern-top.svg) no-repeat left top, url(./assets/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg)
      no-repeat right bottom, var(--dark-cyan);
  background-position: left 10% top 10%, right 10% bottom 10%;
  background-size: 50%, 50%;
}
```

This setup allowed me to create a visually appealing diagonal background design with two images, showcasing precise control over background positioning and layering.

### Continued Development

I plan to continue focusing on:

- Improving accessibility by ensuring color contrast ratios meet WCAG guidelines.
- Experimenting more with background positioning and custom animations.
- Enhancing performance by optimizing assets like images and fonts.
